# Crop Recommendation - TopÂ Crops


A predictive model for forecasting demand and supply information of top crops.
The processed system is to predict the type of crop to be grown in a particular season based on the requirements and can be used to help farmers to identify the crops easily by just providing their soil fertility information based on previous testings. The system provides the information about the following requirements:

1) N, P, K content: In this module the system will provide the NPK ratio that refers to the three numbers that indicate the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in an NPK fertilizer. A 20-20-20 fertilizer, for example, would have 20% nitrogen, 20% phosphorus, and 20% potassium. This provides the ratio of NPK content present in the soil.

2) Temperature: In this module the system provides us the idea about the temperature requirement based on the land and surroundings. High temperature, even for short period, affects crop growth especially in temperate crops like wheat. High air temperature reduces the growth of shoots and in turn reduces root growth.

3) Humidity: In this module the system controls directly the rate of transpirational water loss and stomatal aperture of plants. Thus, humidity regulates photosynthetic rates, tissue temperatures, plant water potentials, and concentrations of Calcium in certain tissues. Humidity also controls water taken in by tissues through condensation and direct vapour uptake.

4) pH: In this module the system tells us about the pH of the soil and the crop suitable fot that pH. Soil pH is used to indicate the acidity (or alkalinity) of soil, and is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the soil solution.

5) Rainfall: In this module the system gets us the information about the rainfall requirement for a particular crop through out its growth for the healthy yield. When rain is plentiful, crops can absorb the water and nutrients they need, and the soil around them remains moist and fertile. This allows the plants to grow and produce large, healthy yields.

6) Label: In this module the system and the datasets represents the label as types of crop (Rice, Maize, Chickpea, Kidney beans, Pigeonpeas, Mothbeans, Mungbean, Blackgram, Lentil, Pomegranate, Banana, Mango, Grapes, Watermelon, Muskmelon, Apple, Orange, Papaya, Coconut, Cotton, Jute, Coffee).

7) Finally the accuracy rate obtained by the classification report made is 97/100.
